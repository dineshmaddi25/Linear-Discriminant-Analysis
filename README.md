##### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for Wine Dataset
This project focuses on applying Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to the Wine dataset. 
It involves clustering visualization and evaluating the accuracy using various classifiers such as Logistic Regression, 
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier. Cohen's Kappa is utilized to measure the exactness in accuracy.

#### Requirements
numpy (import numpy as np)
pandas (import pandas as pd)
matplotlib.pyplot (import matplotlib.pyplot as plt)
sklearn

## Wine Dataset
The Wine dataset contains information about different varieties of wine. It includes 13 features, such as alcohol content, acidity levels, and phenols, along with the class labels specifying the origin of each wine sample.

## Project Structure
lda_wine.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for Linear Discriminant Analysis on the Wine dataset, clustering visualization, and accuracy evaluation using various classifiers.



## Usage
Install the required libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn.

## Clone the repository:

 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lda-wine.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Copy code
cd lda-wine
Open and run the lda_wine.ipynb notebook using Jupyter.

Results
The project demonstrates the application of Linear Discriminant Analysis for dimensionality reduction and visualization of the Wine dataset. Additionally, it evaluates the classification accuracy of various machine learning classifiers, providing insights into the performance of each model.
